# pyserializer

## Description

A library for serialization of Python objects.

## Usage

```python
import pyserializer
```

### macOS

You can install `python` on macOS using homebrew with `brew install python`.

To install `direnv` on `macOS` use `brew install direnv`.  If using bash, then add `eval \"$(direnv hook bash)\"` to the `~/.bash_profile` file .  If using zsh, then add `eval \"$(direnv hook zsh)\"` to the `~/.zshrc` file.

## Development

You can setup a local development environment using the following commands.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to run Python linting checks with `make flake8`, install flake8 with the following command.

```shell
pip install flake8
```

## Testing

**CLI**

To run CLI testes use `make test_cli`, which uses [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2).  If you recive a `shunit2:FATAL Please declare TMPDIR with path on partition with exec permission.` error, you can modify the `TMPDIR` environment variable in line or with `export TMPDIR=<YOUR TEMP DIRECTORY HERE>`. For example:

```shell
TMPDIR="/usr/local/tmp" make test_cli
```

**Python**

To run Go tests use `make test_python` (or `bash scripts/test.sh`), which runs unit tests, `go vet`, `go vet with shadow`, [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck), [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/), and [misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell).
